![Block Diagram](Updated%20Block.png)

This block diagram was made to fulfill the need for a human interface for my teams project. None of the part numbers have been selected due to not choosing parts as of yet. This system is designed to display a planet to the user and then with a series of inputs, would be able to see the equivalent gravity of said planet. Also the units for the planets gravity would change with an input. More information about my teams subsystem can be found [here](https://egr314-2025-s-301.github.io/main-page/).
